Title:	Administrator Interface for the Freedge Tracker System
===============================================================================
Description:	This is the Administrator Interface module for the Freedge
                Tracker System. It is the main driver for the system, and
                is responsible for both I/O from an administrator and the
                GUI display to the admin (the user).

class AdministratorInterface:
    """
    The class responsible for the main interface of the Freedge Tracker System.
    It manages both the I/O and the GUI display to the Freedge Administrators.
    
    Attributes
    ===========================================================================
    fdb_path: str
        The full path to open the internal database file
        
    fdb: FreedgeDatabase
        This is instance of the freedge_tracker_database class which is currently open
        in the system, if any. The abbreviation stands for "Freedge database."
        
    root: Tk
        The root of the GUI display, created by calling Tk().
    
    notebook: Notebook
        The tkinter Notebook responsible for displaying the table of freedge
        database information. It contains two tabs: the main_tab, which shows
        the list of all the freedges, and the ood_tab, which shows the list of
        freedges with out of date information.

    main_tab
       The GUI for displaying the table list of all freedges in the database.
       A child of self.notebook.
       
    ood_tab
        The GUI for showing the table list of all freedges in the database
        which are considered to be "out-of-date".
        A child of self.notebook
    
    info_box
        GUI tkinter Frame for displaying information about a particular
        freedge, updated whenever the user clicks on an entry in the table.
    
    info_label
        The tkinter Label which controls the text of the currently selected
        freedge info. A child of info_box.
        
    ib_width
        Fixed width to maintain consistency for the info_box display Labels.
    
    prompt_label
        A tkinter Label which shows text instructions prompting the user for
        action. This is shown when no database has been loaded yet, and is
        destroyed after a database has been loaded into the system.
    
    Methods
    ===========================================================================
    __init__()
        Initializes a new instance of the admin_interface class.
        Requires no arguments.
    
    CreateDatabase()
        Creates a new internal freedge database. Both the csv file to load and
        the location/name of the new db file to save to are chosen by the user
        via popup prompts. Calls SelectCSVFile(), SelectDBSave(), and
        OpenDatabase().
    
    LoadDatabase(db_file_path)
        Opens the database at the given path, loading the database into the
        system and updating the internal file which stores the most recently
        accessed databse file. Called by SelecteDatabaseToLoad() and the
        main driver module, freedge_tracker.py.
    
    SelectCSV()
        Prompts the user to choose a csv file to load during the creation of a
        new database. Returns the chosen path if one is selected successfully,
        or None otherwise. Called by CreateDatabase().
        
    SelectDBSave()
        Prompts the user to choose the name and location of the db file to
        save their newly created database to. Returns the chosen path if one
        is selected successfully, or None otherwise. Called by CreateDatabase().
    
    SelectAndOpenDB()
        Prompts the user to choose a preexisting SQL database file (.db) to
        load into the system, updating the display with the information in
        the chosen db file. Calls LoadDatabase() and UpdateFullDisplay().
        Called by pressing the tkinter button labeled 'Load Database'.
    
    UpdateDatabase()
        Updates the currently loaded database file (db) with information from
        a new csv file that the user selects. Informaton about freedges which
        will be added to, removed from, and modified within the database is
        displayed to the user, allowing them to confirm or cancel the update.
    
    GetSelected()
        Returns the Freedge object corresponding to the user's currently
        selected entry in the display table, if any. If nothing is selected,
        the function returns None.
        
    OnTableClick()
        Called when the user clicks on an entry in the GUI table listing the
        freedge data entries. Calls GetSelected(), updating the info_box with
        the newly selected data, if any.
        
    NotifyFreedge(freedge)
        Sends a notification to the caretaker of the passed-in Freedge object.
    
    NotifySelected()
        Sends a notification to the caretaker of the freedge that is currently
        selected by the user in the display table, if any. Called when the user
        clicks on the GUI button 'Notify Selected'.
    
    NotifyOutOfDate()
        Sends a notification to each of the caretakers who have not been
        contacted in the amount of time defined by FIRST_UPDATE_THRESHOLD in
        the constants file (internal_data/database_constants.py). The system
        first prompts the user with information about the freedges which will
        be messaged, allowing them to confirm or cancel the mass-send.
    
    UpdateFullDisplay()
        Updates the GUI display to reflect the currently loaded database
        information. This is called on system startup, anytime a notification
        reply is received from a caretaker, as well as any time a new database
        is created/loaded.
        
    UpdateTableDisplay(table, freedges: [Freedge])
        Updates the information in a particular display table to contain the
        information stored in the array of Freedge objects passed in. This
        avoids duplicate code when updating the table tabs ('All', the main
        tab, and 'Out of Date', the tab showing only the out of date freedges).
        
    BuildTable(tab)
        Constructs the GUI elements necessary for a display table, using the
        passed-in tab argument as the parent object.
    
    AddButton(parent, label, cmd, xpos, ypos)
        Creates a new button on the GUI display. Sets the parent, the text
        label, the command (function) to call when pressing the button, and
        the position of the button based on the given parameters.
        
    CreateDisplay()
        Builds the full tkinter GUI display of the Administrator Interface.
        
    exit_
        Exits the program.
