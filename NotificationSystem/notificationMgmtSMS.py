Title:	 SMS Notification Management
===============================================================================
Description:	This is skeleton code to be updated with Twilio in order to 
                send notifications via SMS. Twilio is a paid service and therefore 
                we are not using it in the prototype. 

                The SMS system will function through inheriting the notification class.
                The NotificationMgmt is created using modularity so any future notification
                type can be added without touching the main NotificationMgmt file. In order
                for a future developer to implement texting, they will need to add to implement
                the notify_and_update function within the class.

                Information on Twilio for setting up SMS:
