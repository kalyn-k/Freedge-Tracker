Title:	Notification GUI
===============================================================================
Description:	TODO: check--> The NotificationGUI is a prototype popup display of what a notification 
                from Freedge will look like. Because of money constraints, we were unable
                to purchase a Twilio Subscription to send real notifications. When signaled
                in NotificationMgmt, the notificationGUI will pop up with a message asking
                a caretaker if their fridge is still active. The Caretaker (or in this case,
                the user demonstrating the prototype) will select "YES" or "NO" and then 
                send the reply back to the main system in order to update the database of 
                current active fridges.

    This class creates a pop-up window upon each class instantiation to send a notification
    to freedge caretakers. The class determines whether or not a freedge is still active
    as a result of the pop-up window options. This class is for the prototype only and serves to 
    demonstrate how a notification will be sent out, recieved, and interpreted by the system.
